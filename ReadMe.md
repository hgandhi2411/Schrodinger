Quantum mechanics is the study of small particles, of the order of an atom. Schrödinger equation was developed by Erwin Schrodinger to describe the behaviour of quantum mechanical systems. The Schrödinger equation describes how a quantum system changes with time and characterizes the permitted stationary states of a quantum mechanical system.

The Schrödinger equation is given by:

Where ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Chat%7BH%7D) is a Hamiltonian operator on a given wave function ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cpsi%28x%29), *E* is the energy of the state, ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%24%24V_0%24%24) is a constant potential energy, *c* is a constant, and ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cnabla%5E2) is the Laplacian. The wave function that satisfies this equation is the one that describes the system.
