# Schrödinger Equation: Variational Solution


## Overview
---
Quantum mechanics is the study of small particles, of the order of an atom. Schrödinger equation was developed by Erwin Schrodinger to describe the behaviour of quantum mechanical systems. The Schrödinger equation describes how a quantum system changes with time and characterizes the permitted stationary states of a quantum mechanical system.

The Schrödinger equation is given by:

The wave function that satisfies this equation is the one that describes the system.
